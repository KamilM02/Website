  <h1>THE PROBLEM</h1>

  <!--Info taken from https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/plastic-pollution -->
<p>Plastics made from fossil fuels are just over a century old. Production and development of thousands of new plastic products accelerated after World War II, so transforming the modern age that life without plastics would be unrecognizable today. Plastics revolutionized medicine with life-saving devices, made space travel possible, lightened cars and jets—saving fuel and pollution—and saved lives with helmets, incubators, and equipment for clean drinking water.
The conveniences plastics offer, however, led to a throw-away culture that reveals the material’s dark side: today, single-use plastics account for 40 percent of the plastic produced every year. Many of these products, such as plastic bags and food wrappers, have a lifespan of mere minutes to hours, yet they may persist in the environment for hundreds of years.</p>
<h2>HOW <u>YOU</u> CAN HELP</h2>

<!-- Info taken from https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/ocean/help-our-ocean.html -->
<p><b>1. Conserve Water:</b> Use less water so excess runoff and wastewater will not flow into the ocean.
<br><b>2. Reduce Pollutants:</b> Choose nontoxic chemicals and dispose of herbicides, pesticides, and cleaning products properly.</br>
<b>3. Reduce Waste:</b> Cut down on what you throw away.
<br><b>4. Shop Wisely:</b> Choose sustainable seafood. Buy less plastic and bring a reusable bag.</br>
<b>5. Reduce Vehicle Pollution:</b> Use fuel efficient vehicles, carpool or ride a bike.
<br><b>6. Use Less Energy:</b> Choose energy efficient light bulbs and don't overset your thermostat.</br>
<b>7. Fish Responsibly:</b> Follow "catch and release" practices and keep more fish alive.
<br><b>8. Practice Safe Boating:</b> Anchor in sandy areas far from coral and sea grasses. Adhere to "no wake" zones.</br>
<b>9. Respect Habitat:</b> Healthy habitat and survival go hand in hand. Treat with care.
<br><b>10. Volunteer:</b> Volunteer for cleanups at the beach and in your community. You can get involved in protecting your watershed too!</br></p>
